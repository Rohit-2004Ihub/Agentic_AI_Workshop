## 1. 1. **What are the most effective and equitable policy interventions to mitigate climate change in rapidly urbanizing regions of the Global South, considering both economic development goals and social justice concerns?**  (Focuses on policy, equity, and developing nations)
### Socially just population policies can mitigate climate change while ...
“From both climate and social justice perspectives, affluent overconsumption by the wealthy must be addressed immediately, for example through policies like eco-taxes such as carbon pricing,” Ripple added. “Reducing fertility rates alone is clearly not enough. The middle class and rich must be responsible for most of the needed reduction in emissions.” [...] “Social justice and the climate emergency demand that equitable population policies be prioritized in parallel with strategies involving energy, food, nature, short-lived pollutants and the economy,” Ripple said. “With feedback loops, tipping points and potential climate catastrophe looming, we have to be taking steps in all of those areas and not ignoring any of them.”

Eileen Crist of Virginia Tech joined Ripple and Wolf in authoring the paper. [...] Steve Lundeberg, 541-737-4039

### Climate Change, Hunger and Migration: A Vicious Circle in Africa?
These changes caused by climate change have a significant impact on food security in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Droughts, floods, heatwaves and fluctuations in rainfall directly [affect agricultural productivity](https://www.ilri.org/news/climate-change-africa-what-will-it-mean-agriculture-and-food-security) and lead to lower crop yields overall. This applies not least to cereals such as maize, millet and sorghum, which are of great importance for feeding the estimated 500 to 600 [...] Many fear that the consequences of climate change, increasing food insecurity and migration in sub-Saharan Africa are mutually reinforcing. However, reality is far more complex.

### Climate change as a game changer: Rethinking Africa's food security
Simultaneously, drought-driven migration to urban peripheries forces displaced populations into informal settlements with limited access to diverse diets, amplifying reliance on processed foods high in sugar and fats. This dietary transition, coupled with contaminated water sources in overcrowded camps, fuels a dual burden of malnutrition and waterborne diseases, as seen in the cholera outbreaks plaguing drought-stricken regions in Kenya. Such dynamics illustrate how environmental shocks [...] propagate waterborne diseases such as cholera, particularly in densely populated urban areas with inadequate sanitation infrastructure[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99276-2#ref-CR48 "Trisos, C., et al., Africa.

### The Role of Precision Agriculture in Sustainable Farming Practices
In conclusion, precision agriculture plays a pivotal role in advancing sustainable farming practices by enhancing resource efficiency, minimizing environmental footprint, improving crop health and productivity, empowering data-driven decision-making, and promoting long-term sustainability. As the global population continues to grow and environmental pressures mount, the adoption of precision agriculture becomes increasingly imperative in ensuring the resilience and viability of agricultural [...] Ultimately, the adoption of precision agriculture is essential for ensuring the long-term sustainability of farming systems. By embracing innovative technologies and practices, farmers can address the challenges posed by climate change, resource scarcity, and population growth. Precision agriculture allows farmers to adapt to changing environmental conditions, improve resilience, and maintain productivity in the face of uncertainty. By prioritizing sustainability, farmers can safeguard the [...] precision agriculture contributes to the long-term health and resilience of ecosystems.

### The Environmental Benefits of Precision Agriculture Quantified - AEM
“In all the data we have seen thus far, current adoption equates to roughly 10.1 million metric tons avoided,” Blades said. “Another 17.3 million metric tons could be avoided through broader adoption of precision agriculture. This takes into consideration the more efficient use of land, herbicide reduction, fertilizer efficiency, water usage, and fossil fuels from machinery. All of these things come together to tell a really great story.” [...] The story could get even greater with more widespread adoption of precision agriculture technologies.

## 6. 6. **How do differing communication strategies (e.g., fear appeals versus hope-framed messaging) affect public perception and engagement with climate change, and what are the implications for effective climate action mobilization?** (Focuses on communication strategies, public opinion, and behavioral change.)
### In green communications, fear and hope have different uses | Trellis
Results showed that when the message was framed as global, an appeal based upon fear enhanced viewers’ attention, engendered a more positive attitude toward the green issue and changed behavioral intention more than a hope-centric appeal did. However, when the issue was presented in a local context, a hope-focused appeal was more effective. [...] In comparison, the global ad featuring the “fear” appeal ran a headline that read, “Doing the Wrong Things Puts Polar Bears in Danger,” followed by the same polar bear drawing and copy that said, “The increasing amount of trash destroys the ecological environment, and sadly, polar bears will disappear from this Earth!”

The “fear” technique was more effective in achieving the desired response from participants in the global ad campaign. [...] Here, the “hope” approach was found to be more effective when the environmental issue was framed as a local concern.

Green communications aren’t always an easy sell to the public because climate change and other ecological issues aren’t immediately tangible or easily explained. Therefore, it is essential to understand when to use a message of fear versus hope in ads dealing with environmental issues, as they both influence people differently on a global and local level.

### Effective Advocacy and Communication Strategies at the ...
norm that most people are concerned about climate change. Solutions-focused messages may also help build climate policy support, mobilize people to engage in advocacy, and activate positive, motivating emotions, like hope. In addition, climate and health messages that first evoke fear and then follow up with hope-inspiring content may also strengthen people’s intentions to engage in climate advocacy. Future research should include different geographies and strengthen the evidence on the [...] especially engaging among Americans across partisan lines. A multinational study found that in Germany, a more negative focus on the health threat of climate change increased support for climate change mitigation policies relative to a more positive message focused on the health benefits of climate action, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in other countries, including China, the UK, and the USA. While additional research would be helpful—especially beyond the United States—the existing

Marlon jennifer.marlon@yale.edu Specialty section: This article was submitted to Science and Environmental [...] Messages about the realistic solutions that exist for reducing climate change impacts can directly address the need for hope, while information about the known causes of climate change (Ranney and Clark, 2016) can address misconceptions that produce false hope. Likewise, messages that address common doubts about climate change may reinforce constructive hope, while information that addresses response-eﬃcacy may help limit fatalistic doubt (e.g., the feeling that it is already too late).

### Fear Appeals in Climate Change Communication
climate change communication is typically that of “communication and engagement,” with little explicit reference to targeted social influence or behavior change, although this is clearly implied. Hence underlying and intertwined issues here are those of cogent arguments versus largely absent evidence, and effectiveness as distinct from appropriateness. These matters are enmeshed within the broader contours of the contested political, social, and environmental, issues status of climate change, [...] Printed from Oxford Research Encyclopedias, Climate Science.
